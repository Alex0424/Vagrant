# What is Vagrant?

It is a VM automation tool wich uses Hypervisors to manage vm's on our host-machine.

A Vagrant box is essentially a pre-packaged virtual machine image
- Box Size: 500 MB â€“ 2 GB
- They are lighter than manually managing full VM snapshots
  - no GUI, minimal services
- They are heavier compared to containers because they run a full guest operating system on a hypervisor.
